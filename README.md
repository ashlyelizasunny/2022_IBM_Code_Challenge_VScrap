# 2022_IBM_Code_Challenge_VScrap
This project is made as part of IBM ISL Good Tech Scholar program 2022. This Application allows the user to register for scrappage of their vehicles.

## Problem Statement
The scrappage policy launched on August 13th 2021,is a government founded programme to replace old vehicles to new and modern ones. As per the vehicle scrappage policy 2021, private cars that are older than 20 years and commercial vehicles older than 15 years will be deregistered.The vehicles that pass the test can be re-registered. But those vehicles failing the test need to be scrapped.
# 
The key objective behind the new scrappage policy is to figure out those unfit vehicles and methodically recycle them. The eventual aim behind the scrap policy is to eliminate the pollution in the environment caused by such vehicles. This car scrappage policy will reduce pollution and also provide other benefits. It means that it will enable to recycling of things such as steel, plastic, and other metals. The manufacturing cost will also be reduced. With the vehicle scrappage policy in place, it is expected that the vehicle sale will increase.
#
But, there is no real time applications,that allows the users to register for scrappage of vehicle in online mode.The project entitled ”VScrap” is a web application that allows the user to register for scrappage of their vehicles and schedule the date as per their convenience.
